Make sure to use .mov for the output format while encoding,

Don't use quotation around the input file path, only use characters accepted by fopen(),

Always decode into the format you encoded from i.e. if you encoded a .zip file decode into a .zip file,

If you can't playback the resulting .mov file use mpv->https://mpv.io
